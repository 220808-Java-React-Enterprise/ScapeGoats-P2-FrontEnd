### Usage

Upon visiting our site, a user will be prompted to either sign up or login. A user can sign up by providing an email and creating a username and password. Once the account is created they will be able to login with those credentials. Once logged in a user can choose to receive a tarot reading by selecting a category that they would like to receive a reading for. The user will then receive three tarot cards as their reading which possess various meanings. The user can then either choose to save or discard their reading. If saved the user can then view that reading in their reading history where all saved readings are stored. Users can also request a consultation with a third-party consultant if they wish to discuss their reading.
